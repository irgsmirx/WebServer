WebServer
=========

A working modular HTTP(S) server.

This project started as a proof for me that it was possible to get my own web server up and running.

Later I found a first real application to use it for: my WebMusicPlayer.

To make it more useful I started adding support for CGI.


How to use
----------

There are a few (up to now only 2) examples in com.ramforth.webserver.examples which should give you
an idea of how to get this web server up and running.
